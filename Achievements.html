        <h2>International Baccalaureate (IB) International Night (2020)</h2>
        <p class="text">
            In high school, I was a part of the IB Academic Program, and one of the many events that incorporate IB students' work
            is International Night. IB students form pairs together and create a poster consisting of information about a country 
            of their choosing. In addition to the poster, students would also bring in two food items that originated from their assigned country.
            Students who were taking a particular foreign language class tended to pick countries that spoke the language
            they were learning. This informational event allowed students, teachers, and anyone who attended to learn more about different countries and 
            gave them an opportunity to try new foods that are popular in other countries.
            <br><br>
            I participated in International Night both my junior and senior year; however, in addition to participating
            in the event as a senior, I, along with another student, were in charge of coordinating the entire event. This involved us
            meeting up often with each other and with our teacher advisor to discuss certain aspects of the event. For example, there was a raffle wherein attendees
            of the event had a chance to win a variety of different ethnic foods. My partner and I had to set up the particulars pertaining to the raffle, and we made several
            trips to different ethnic markets to buy food as the raffle prizes. Another aspect of the event was deciding how to set up the
            large area we had to work within, so that it was not only organized with everyone's work presented clearly, but we also needed to take into consideration
            which countries to group together and which booths needed outlets for their food. 
            <br><br>
            Though it was a lot of work and involved planning months in advance, I was very proud of the work and was pleased with how the event turned out.

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p class="text">
            My experience of programming languages and coding stems from the courses I have taken throughout my academic career. My first experience in coding
            was in my senior year, where I learned about simple JavaScript code. I liked working with JavaScript because, in regard to web development, you are 
            able to watch as your web application is being built as you code, and to me that is an interesting process to view. For this course, we needed to submit
            a project that demonstrated our knowledge of coding. I decided to create a web app that gave the user a choice of playing three simple games. Each one 
            had a different objective and demonstrated different coding skills.
            <br><br>
            I have expanded my knowledge of computer science and programming languages immensely in college. I learned Java my first year and C++ my second year. 
            I am continually adding to my knowledge of programming languages and my ability to code, such as learning web development languages. For more 
            information on what programming languages I have experience in, see the Qualifications page.
