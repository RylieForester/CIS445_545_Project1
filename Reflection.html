        <h2>Life Goals</h2>
        <p class="text">
            In terms of my life goals, they have developed and taken shape these past couple of years. In my junior year of high school, I was still unsure of 
            what exactly I wanted to study in college. My cousins introduced me to the topic of computer science and I immediately became interested. I did 
            some research on my own and, after taking a basic computer science class my senior year in high school, I became very interested in computer science and 
            programming. Thus, I chose Computer Information Systems (CIS) as my major upon being accepted at Bradley. After some more research and seeing what
            curriculm was offered at Bradley, I also decided to apply for a concentration in Computer, Web, and Software Security. I have also taken an
            interest in web development and the languages used for such coding, and would be interested in learning more about it. Though I am still unsure of the
            exact details of what I would like in my future career, I am still excited to learn more and expand on my growing knowledge of computer science.

        <h2>Learning</h2>
        <p class="text">
            I consider myself to be an avid learner. I enjoy the fact that I can learn and gain information about anything I have a desire to learn about. I also feel 
            that I have developed a perseverence when it comes to learning. With regard to computer science, when I started my first year in college, I was very excited 
            to learn more about the topic; however, I quickly found that I was struggling to understand the material of the course and thought that I may need to
            change majors. Ultimately, I decided to stick with studying computer science because I was genuinely interested in learning more about it, and I am glad
            I did. I have enjoyed the classes that I have taken since then, and am excited to take my upcoming classes. Through my struggles with my classes,
            I have also learned different ways in which I can improve on my learning and utilize those methods in order to gain a better understanding of this subject.
