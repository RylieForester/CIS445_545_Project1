        <h2>Brief Biography</h2>
        <p class="text">
            Currently a third year student attending Bradley University, I am studying Computer Information Systems (CIS) with a concentration in Software, Web, and Computer Security. 
            My computer science experience includes courses taken both at Bradley and Richwoods High School. Through these courses, I have become familiar with Java, C++, 
            Linux, Git and GitHub, and am now learning web development languages such as HTML and CSS. 
            <br>
            In high school, I was a part of the International Baccalaureate (IB) program, where I took classes that helped prepare me for Bradley and earned me college credit hours.
            I also accumulated many volunteer hours with a variety of organizations, including WildLife Prairie Park and Forest Park Nature Center. 
        </p>

        <h2>Values and Beliefs</h2>
        <p class="text">
            I believe that it is important in both an academic and professional environment that everyone is treated with respect. We are all here to learn and it is critical that we respect each other,
            no matter our experience levels, so that we are able to create meaningful relationships with others, as well as create a safe and amicable environment for everyone. 
            <br>
            I also value taking care of one's mental health. I am a strong believer that mental health is just as important as physical health, and both should be a priority in a person's everyday life. 
            There is the stigma that mental health should not be publicly discussed; however, it is conducive for people to talk about their mental health and/or their struggles with it, as it can lead 
            to a healthier lifestyle and allow them to function to their best ability in the home and work environment. 
        </p>

        <h2>Career Aspirations</h2>
        <p class="text">
            With a concentration in computer security, I hope to pursue a career in cybersecurity. My interest in this topic stemmed from one 
            of my cousins who currently has a job in cybersecurity and we have had many discussions about his profession. I have not yet taken any courses regarding security, 
            but am looking forward to learning more about the topic. 
            <br>
            I have also taken an interest in web development because of a course I am currently taking and am excited to learn more about 
            this aspect of computer science.
        </p>

        <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
        <p class="text">
            One of my favorite past times is reading. I love to read a variety of genres, but I tend to read more fiction, as I love to lose myself in the characters and their adventures. 
            I also read the news, as I think it is important to stay up to date with current events in our world. 
            <br>
            I also have an immense passion for art. Though I mainly excel in pencil and ink mediums, I always enjoy exploring and using other art mediums. 
            My topics of illustration range from anime and cartoons, to people, and to the outdoors, especially of flowers.
            <br>
            Another one of my hobbies is photography. I enjoy being outdoors, so it's appropriate that most of the pictures I take are of nature.
            My favorite subjects are animals that I see in the forest by my house, the moon and the sky, and the blooming flowers in my garden.
